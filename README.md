## Pixisphere is a full-stack AI-powered photography service marketplace that connects
clients with verified photographers and studios across India. It's engineered to handle
end-to-end workflows: from discovery and shortlisting, through intelligent lead distribution,
to post-booking lifecycle management.
The platform supports:
● Dynamic service discovery based on categories and geo-location
● Client inquiries with smart suggestions and reference image uploads
● Vendor dashboards with lead, booking, and portfolio tools
● Admin backend with moderation, verification, and CMS control

- Pixisphere is not a typical marketplace. It operates with complex, role-based user flows,
multi-model data structures, AI-aided matching, and moderated interactions — all while
being scale-ready for high-traffic content management and real-time services.

### Design and implement a role-based, modular backend system that mimics Pixisphere’s core
architecture. Your implementation should demonstrate:

● Secure authentication & authorization
● Multi-role user management
● Smart lead creation & distribution
● Vendor verification flow
● Portfolio and booking-ready structures
● Admin moderation APIs

### Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

###  Running the Server
